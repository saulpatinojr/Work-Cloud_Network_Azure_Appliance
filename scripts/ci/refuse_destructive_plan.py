"""
Refuse a Terraform plan that would destroy a resource holding irreplaceable data.

210-deploy runs this on each saved plan right before `terraform apply` (platform
and workload). A release must never delete or replace the log store or the
database: on Azure that is what a stale state layout would have done to the Log
Analytics workspace (TODO.md → T-103, "applying without migrating state first
makes workload destroy the workspace"), and no release has a reason to
destroy the database. If a plan does, the apply is refused and a human decides
— by fixing state (`terraform state rm` / `import`) or, knowingly, by removing
the type from the protected list for that one run.

Usage:
  terraform show -json tfplan | python3 refuse_destructive_plan.py
  python3 refuse_destructive_plan.py plan.json

Environment:
  PROTECTED_RESOURCE_TYPES  comma-separated Terraform resource types that must
                            never be deleted or replaced by this plan, e.g.
                            "azurerm_log_analytics_workspace,azurerm_postgresql_flexible_server"
                            or "aws_cloudwatch_log_group,aws_db_instance".
  PLAN_LABEL                optional name for messages (e.g. "dev/workload").

Exit status is 0 when no protected resource is destroyed, 1 otherwise; output is
plain text so it reads well in a workflow log.
