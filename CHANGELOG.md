## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Initial import from the core repository** (`saulpatinojr/Work-Cloud_Network_Assessment` at `1951830`). The Azure Terraform (`infra/terraform/providers/azure/*` → `infra/terraform/modules/*`, `infra/terraform/environments/azure/{dev,prod}` → `infra/terraform/environments/{dev,prod}`), the deploy and operations workflows (`000`, `100`, `211`/`212` → `210-deploy`, `220`, `320`, `330`, `340`, `350`, `360`), the CI evidence scripts and the release catalog were cut from the core so that customers see one cloud per repository. Module sources were rewritten to the new layout; nothing else in the Terraform changed. `320-publish-portal` lost its `cloud` input — this appliance publishes to Azure Blob Storage only.
- **`230 · Image Update`.** Listens for the core's `cna-image-published` dispatch and polls the core's build manifest every six hours; auto-deploys `dev` through `210` with the recorded `ai_mode`, and opens an `update-available` issue for `prod`. Never touches an environment that has not been deployed once.
- **`300 · Validate`.** This repository's CI: `detect-secrets` (gating), the documentation-model guard, and `terraform fmt` / `terraform validate` on all four roots.
- `README.md` (the intro page), `CLAUDE.md` (agent rules: app code lives in the core; every structural change is mirrored to the sibling appliance), `REVIEW.md`, `TODO.md`, and the `update-available` issue template.
- The dev release catalog (`.deployment-catalog/dev/`) carries over from the core so `230-image-update` and rollback resolution see the environment's real history.
